        "\n",
        "This assignment aims at familiarizing you with training and testing Decision Tree and Random Forest classification model. The dataset you will be working on is 'data-employee-recruitment.csv'. It is composed of attributes such as employee gender, education level, company size, etc., to develop an employee recruitment prediction model. You will have to do:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **(5 points) Coding tasks:** The following questions involve writing code to complete specific tasks.  \n",
        "    1.1 *(1 point)* Load the data-employee-recruitment.csv dataset and perform basic data cleaning, analysis and visualization to have a deep understanding about the data.  \n",
        "    1.2 *(1 point)* Check if the dataset is imbalanced. If necessary, apply SMOTE or another resampling technique to balance the classes.The technique should be applied only to the training set, while the test set should remain unchanged.  \n",
        "    1.3 *(1 point)* Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for both Decision Tree and Random Forest model. Report the best parameters.  \n",
        "    1.4 *(1 point)* Train a Random Forest model and identify the most important features influencing job change predictions. Visualize the feature importance scores.  \n",
        "    1.5 *(1 point)* Train a Decision Tree classifier and visualize the resulting tree structure. Explain any patterns or rules observed from the tree.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **(5 points) Open discussion questions:** These discussion questions ask you to analyze and argue your points.  Feel free to include relevant code examples to strengthen your arguments.  \n",
        "    2.1 *(1 point)* Which features in the dataset do you think are most important for predicting job changes? Did the feature importance analysis confirm your expectations?  \n",
        "    2.2 *(1 point)* How did the performance of the Random Forest model compare to the Decision Tree model? Was this result expected?  \n",
        "    2.3 *(1 point)* When visualizing the Decision Tree, were the splits and decisions intuitive? Did you notice any surprising decision rules?  \n",
        "    2.4 *(1 point)* How could a company use a predictive model like this to improve its hiring and retention strategy? What are the potential benefits and risks?  \n",
        "    2.5 *(1 point)* What part of this assignment did you find most difficult or insightful? If you had more time, what additional improvements would you make?  \n",
